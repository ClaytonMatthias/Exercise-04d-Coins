# Exercise-04c-Enemies

## Implementation
I did not have enough time to implement everything I wanted to since it is already going to be late. I plan on working on the next project much earlier in order to add everything I want.

1. Multiple Levels, 6
2. Larger/elaborate levels (Level 4 is harder skill wise and Level 5 has a simple puzzle to reach the end, the invisible platform)
3. Parallax Backgrounds on all the levels
4. Made Start and end game menus all be it simple ones
5. Score indicators along with lives (Only die from falling as I didnt have time to add damage/death from enemies)
6. Maybe polish?
